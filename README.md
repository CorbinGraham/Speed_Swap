# Speed_Swap
  This is a game I created for mobile devices in the Unity engine. This is my first ever Unity project and was mostly created as a means
  of learning all of the engine mechanics.
  
## Game Modes
  The game is separated into "Selection mode" and "Original mode" both utilizing the same assets with slight gameplay changes.
  ### Selection Mode
  In this game mode the player must simply tap any of the colour buttons on the bottom of the screen to match the colour of the
  upcoming wall. One point is awarded for each wall passed and a high score is saved between instances of the game.
  ### Original Mode
  In "Original mode" the player can tap anywhere on the screen to change to the next colour in the sequence of four colours.
  Points are awarded in the same way as "Selection mode" and a high score is saved between instances of the game.
