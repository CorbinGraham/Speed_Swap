# Speed_Swap
  This is a game I created for mobile devices in the Unity engine. This is my first ever Unity project and was mostly created as a means
  of learning all of the engine mechanics. The game is designed to be challenging and relies on the players reflexes. 
  
## Game Modes
  The game is separated into "Selection mode" and "Original mode" both utilizing the same assets with slight gameplay changes. The colour
  of each wall that the player must pass is decided by a shuffle bag algorithm[1]. This was done instead of the built in random function
  to create a better sense of randomness in the wall colours.
  ### Selection Mode
  In this game mode the player can tap any of the colour buttons on the bottom of the screen to match the colour of the
  upcoming wall. One point is awarded for each wall passed and a high score is saved between instances of the game.
  ### Original Mode
  In "Original mode" the player can tap anywhere on the screen to change to the next colour in the sequence of four colours.
  Points are awarded in the same way as "Selection mode" and a high score is saved between instances of the game.
